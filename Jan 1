Today's scenario:
a) Reading character and integers and how to read strings. 
  a-z -> 97-122
  A-Z->65-90
  0-9 -> 48-56
  Use above for conversions


B) Write a C program to take input string that is combination of integers, alphabets. Print their ascii's .



C) Write a c program to take input string and convert into upper case and lower case


d) Write a c program to take input string and print all the escape characters  and alphabets separately from a given string 
    Eg:   Le\ndi \and kar\theek

  output: \n \a \t
  Ledi nd karheek
